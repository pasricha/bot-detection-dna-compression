How to use
==========

  To use this template:
  1. Extract the files to a designated folder for your poster. At a
     minimum you need the `beamerthemeInsightPoster17.sty' and the
     `poster_background_2017.pdf'.
  2. Copy (or rename) `example.tex' to whatever is an appropriate name
     for your poster, let's call it `yourposter.tex' for now. Avoid
     using spaces or non-ASCII characters for this if possible, LaTeX
     tends to not play well with those.
  3. Edit `yourposter.tex'. The poster is implemented as a beamer theme
     that is intended to be used with the "beamerposter" package.
  4. Convert `yourposter.text' to PDF via `pdflatex'. Other LaTeX
     processors may (and should) work just as well, but I haven't tested
     anything apart from pdflatex.
  5. That's it.

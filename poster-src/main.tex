      \begin{block}{Introduction}
        \justifying{It is estimated that bots make up 9-15\% of all Twitter accounts. A paradigm-shift \cite{Cresci:2017:PSS:3041021.3055135} has been observed in the last few years in the behaviour of Twitter bots where more sophisticated social bots have been identified that can fool traditional bot detection techniques as well as human annotators.}
      \end{block}

      \begin{block}{Digital DNA}
        \justifying{We assume that the long-term behaviour of a bot account is less random than the behaviour of a genuine user and we model the temporal activity \cite{Kan2013} of a Twitter account using the technique of digital DNA \cite{7876716} with the following alphabet: \\ }
            \[ 
                \mathbf{B}^{3}_{type} = 
                \left \{
                  \begin{tabular}{l}
                  $\texttt{A} \leftarrow \textrm{tweet}, $ \\
                  $\texttt{C} \leftarrow \textrm{reply}, $ \\
                  $\texttt{T} \leftarrow \textrm{retweet} $
                  \end{tabular}
                \right \}
            \]
        \end{block}
        \begin{block}{String Compression}
          \justifying{A string \texttt{s} $=$ ``\texttt{ACTCATTTTA}" can represent a sequence of 10 posts made by an account. We employ a string compression algorithm on such digital DNA sequences and use the compression statistics as features to train a logistic regression model that classifies Twitter accounts as bots or genuine users.}

      \begin{block}{Length of Digital DNA Sequence}
        \justifying{We set different limits $L = \{10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000\} $ for the maximum length of the DNA sequence and for each account, we pick a DNA sub-sequence of random length between $1$ and $L$. We observe great improvements in the performance as the DNA sequence length increases. }

      \begin{block}{Conclusion \& Future Work}
        \justifying{Our approach is a fast and scalable extension on the idea of digital DNA, which is language and content independent as well as easy to represent visually. Future work can incorporate other user-profile and content-based features into the digital DNA sequence and apply this technique to identify automated accounts on other social media platforms such as Facebook and Reddit.}
